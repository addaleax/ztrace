Trace what your program does, inspired by `strace(1)`.

Install:
`[sudo] npm install -g ztrace`

Usage:

`test.js`:
```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.statSync('/');
```

Look at the `fs.stat` call in action:

```sh
$ ztrace -e fs.stat* -s unlimited ./test.js
fs.statSync('/')
 @fs.stat('/') = { dev: 2049, mode: 16877, nlink: 25, uid: 0, gid: 0, rdev: 0, blksize: 4096, ino: 2, size: 4096, blocks: 8, atime: 2016-10-31T08:45:52.988Z, mtime: 2016-10-23T16:04:32.775Z, ctime: 2016-10-23T16:04:32.775Z, birthtime: 2016-10-23T16:04:32.775Z }
-> { dev: 2049, mode: 16877, nlink: 25, uid: 0, gid: 0, rdev: 0, blksize: 4096, ino: 2, size: 4096, blocks: 8, atime: 2016-10-31T08:45:52.988Z, mtime: 2016-10-23T16:04:32.775Z, ctime: 2016-10-23T16:04:32.775Z, birthtime: 2016-10-23T16:04:32.775Z }
```

(`@fs.stat` is the call to the C++ layer itself.)

If you want to trace everything, you can do that using just `ztrace ./test.js`
â€“ but be warned: This is still *very* slow.
